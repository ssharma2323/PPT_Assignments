    "Information gain is a concept used in decision trees to quantify the amount of information gained by splitting the data based on a particular feature. It measures the reduction in entropy or disorder in the dataset after the split. A higher information gain indicates a more informative split, where the resulting subsets become more homogeneous in terms of class labels. Decision trees aim to select the feature that maximizes the information gain, as it provides the most valuable and discriminative information for making predictions."
